# JITServer Load Testing and Performance Evaluation

This project is focused on conducting load testing and performance evaluation for the **OpenJ9 JITServer** which is  a distributed runtime system where Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is offloaded to a server. The goal is to analyze and optimize the client-server setup by evaluating various workloads and identifying performance bottlenecks.
